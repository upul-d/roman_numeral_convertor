# BBC Coding Kata - Roman Numerals

## The problem

In whatever language you prefer, write a class that implements the following interface (example given in Java):

```java
public interface RomanNumeralGenerator {
   public String generate(int number); 
}
```

For example, see the following sample inputs and outputs: 

1 = “I” 

5 = “V” 

10 = “X” 

20 = “XX” 

3999 = “MMMCMXCIX”

**Caveat:** Only support numbers between 1 and 3999 

For an in-depth description of Roman Numerals, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals)


## My approach
I will write my solution using a Test Driven Development approach.

The details of my approach, assumptions I have made, or caveats will be filled out here later.
